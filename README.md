# 4 Years guarantees the saga of escaping F

## Overview
4 Years Guarantees the saga of escaping F is the Text-based RPG game, inspired from the life student of Software Engineering in Kasetsart University. The idea started from "How to tranform a typical uni'life in to a RPG game". I've come up with an idea to make the "Subject" that included in the Software Engineering course to be the monster or enemy in my RPG world. The goal of the game is to defeat all of the "Subject" in game to graduate 4 years, or as Aj.Pirawat said "4 years guarantees".
